# Tachy App

## Description
This project is not meant to be downloaded and used. It exists merely to show proof that I have experience coding complicated projects front to back.
* The optimization script shows off my ability to model and optimize a highly complex nurse scheduling problem for an outpatient surgery center based in Wisconsin.
* The other server side code shows off my ability to update and retrieve data from an app database to ensure proper app functionality.

You'll see that I used the anvil.works platform to complete the project. That platform hosts my code and also enabled me to use only Python to complete the entire project, which at the time I thought was interesting and particularly suitable for the project requirements since I needed to use the Python Pulp library to solve the optimization problem.
